### Weather Part

Using the OpenWeatherMap API we retrieved weather data from the cities list generated in the starter code. Next, we created a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

      Latitude vs. Temperature

      Latitude vs. Humidity

      Latitude vs. Cloudiness

      Latitude vs. Wind Speed

Computed the linear regression for each relationship. Separated the plots into Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere.

Create the following plots:

      Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude

      Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude

      Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude

      Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude

      Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude

      Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude

      Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude

      Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude

### Vacation Part

The goal of this project is to plan future vacations:

  1. Created a map that displays a point for every city in the dataFrame. The size of the point is the humidity in each city.

  2. Narrowed down the dataFrame to find my ideal weather condition. 

  3. Created a new DataFrame called to store the city, country, coordinates, and humidity.

  4. For each city, used the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 meters of my coordinates.

  5. Created a map and added the hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message for each city.
